		"summary": "In December, far-left activist Greta Thunberg struck a somber, defeatist tone while speaking to fellow climate activists gathered at the United Nations climate talks in Madrid, Spain.
Thunberg claimed that people are currently “suffering and dying” due to effects of supposed man-made climate change. Since 2017, Thunberg has been pushed by politicos on the far-left and their allies in the media to lead the climate change agenda, which conveniently promotes socialist policies as solutions.
