SARS-like coronaviruses are found in bats, pigs, cats, and ferrets, etc. The most widely agreed upon origin of SARS-CoV-2 is that its ancestors moved around in wild animals\\\\u2014swapping genetic features as they went along\\\\u2014before they jumped into humans. The virus may have moved directly into people from bats, or first jumped into another animal, such as a pangolin, before transitioning into humans.\", \"link\": \"\", \"image\": \"1.jpeg\"}, {\"id\": \"2\", \"headline\": \"Fact-check: Bill Gates is not responsible for Covid-19\", \"summary\": \"A false claim that the Covid-19 pandemic was planned by Bill Gates is circulating on the internet based on an old quote by Gates about pandemic readiness. There is no evidence that the pandemic was deliberately planned or that Bill Gates has any links with such a plan. Covid-19 is believed to have spread from an animal to a person much like MERS and SARS and there is no indication or publicly available evidence suggesting that the coronavirus was \\\\\"designed\\\\\".\", \"link\": \"\", \"image\": \"2.jpeg\"}, {\"id\": \"3\", \"headline\": \"Natural herd immunity is not a viable option for protection against the coronavirus\", \"summary\": \"Experts estimate that roughly 60 to 70 percent of people would need to get COVID-19 for herd immunity to be possible. Given the high mortality rate of the disease, letting it infect that many people could lead to millions of deaths. As is evidenced in two countries that tried this approach early on in the pandemic, the U.K.\\\\u2019s COVID-19 death rate is among the world\\\\u2019s highest whereas Sweden has had significantly more deaths than neighbouring countries, and its economy has suffered despite the lack of a shutdown.\", \"link\": \"\", \"image\": \"3.png\"}, {\"id\": \"4\", \"headline\": \"Instagram post wrongly claims that Covid-19 death reports are exaggerated\", \"summary\": \"An Instagram post from Robert F.

The CDC has for years monitored deaths of pneumonia and influenza together as one measure of the flu\\\\u2019s mortality. As of an update on Jan 29, the provisional death count reported 431,619 deaths attributed to Covid-19 in the US.

This is false; mRNA vaccines - the type of vaccines developed for Covid-19, deliver genetic instructions to build these proteins directly into the cells, effectively turning the body into a vaccine-making factory.
