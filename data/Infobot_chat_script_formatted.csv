d4,NASA and NOAA’S latest climate warning is a result of purposefully flawed data.,"NASA and NOAA announced that 2019 was the second warmest year since modern record keeping began in 1880. But as has been hammered home repeatedly over the years by meteorologist Anthony Watts  (who is also a Senior Fellow with The Heartland Institute), rather than cite data from their best sources, NASA and NOAA chose to use severely compromised data from temperature readings adjusted—in a process called “homogenization”—they and others gathered from biased monitoring stations. Numerous reports have shown data manipulation is not limited to the United States, but is common across the globe.",https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/nasa-and-noaas-latest-climate-warning-is-a-result-of-purposefully-flawed-data,https://www.heartland.org/sebin/h/n/Climate.jpg
a4,"Greenland, Antarctica Melting Six Times Faster Than in the 1990s","Observations from 11 satellite missions monitoring the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have revealed that the regions are losing ice six times faster than they were in the 1990s. If the current melting trend continues, the regions will be on track to match the ""worst-case"" scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of an extra 6.7 inches (17 centimetres) of sea level rise by 2100. The findings, published in the journal Nature from an international team of 89 polar scientists from 50 organizations, are the most comprehensive assessment to date of the changing ice sheets.",https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2958/greenland-antarctica-melting-six-times-faster-than-in-the-1990s/,https://imagecache.jpl.nasa.gov/images/640x350/greenland20200316-16-640x350.jpg
p1,AOC deletes gleeful tweet on oil industry's coronavirus collapse: 'You absolutely love to see it',"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez faced a torrent of social-media backlash on Monday after tweeting her “love” for the oil industry’s pandemic-prompted implosion. News that oil prices have spiralled into “negative values” prompted the New York Democrat to send out a gleeful tweet to her 6.7 million followers. “You absolutely love to see it,” she tweeted. The message was soon deleted and replaced. Critics noted the stark contrast in rhetoric. Some responses include: “Cheering for the collapse of an industry that supports millions of people is a perfect example of why your proposal has failed to garner meaningful support.” and “You’re literally basking in the pink slips of American workers. Disgraceful.”",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/apr/20/aoc-deletes-gleeful-tweet-on-oil-industrys-coronav/,https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2020/01/26/Election_2020_Bernie_Sanders_60461.jpg-4e768_c0-379-5472-3569_s885x516.jpg?79beb960f0e00b628bd5fdbfd870ccee1dbf2e2a
p2,Covid-19 Highlights Trump’s Malignant Narcissism — And Proves Americans Will Survive Despite Him,"Major catastrophes lay bare the truth about our leaders. Trump’s criminally negligent, chaotic handling of the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed, once and for all, that he is a corrupt, narcissistic psychopath. Because of COVID-19, the nation now recognizes what should have been obvious ever since Trump took office: His first response to every crisis is to insist on complete authority, while at the same time abandoning all responsibility. Despite his inaction and incompetence, he won’t relinquish control over the government’s resources to those who know how to use them. Thus, in the total absence of national leadership or direction, governors have had to take charge, leading Trump to lash out at them.",https://theintercept.com/2020/04/22/trump-coronavirus-governors/,https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2020/04/GettyImages-1210379159.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90&w=1024&h=683
b1,Pope Francis Disgraces Himself with Coronavirus-Climate change Blood Libel,"Pope Francis said he believes the Chinese coronavirus pandemic is “certainly nature’s response” to humanity’s failure to address the “partial catastrophes” wrought by human-induced climate change. Pope Francis blaming the coronavirus epidemic on humanity, specifically humanity’s failure to address Climate Change (which is a hoax) is nothing short of a blood libel. This is absolutely disgraceful. This is no different than blaming this China virus plague on abortion or homosexuality, which is something we have heard from the fringes during other human tragedies and disasters.",https://www.breitbart.com/faith/2020/04/09/nolte-pope-francis-disgraces-himself-with-coronavirus-blood-libel/,https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/11/Pope-Weinandy-640x480.jpg
b2,Fall in COVID-linked carbon emissions won’t halt climate change - UN weather agency chief,"An expected drop in greenhouse gas emissions linked to the global economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is only “short-term good news”, said Professor Petteri Taalas, World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Secretary-General, in reference to a 5.5 to 5.7 per cent fall in levels of carbon dioxide due to the pandemic, that have been flagged by leading climate experts, including the Center for International Climate Research. “There might even be a boost in emissions because some of the industries have been stopped”, the WMO head cautioned. Latest data from WMO published to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, on 22 April, indicates that carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere rose to new records last year.",https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/04/1062332,https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/Libraries/Production+Library/02-03-2020-Mogobane-Botswana.jpg/image1170x530cropped.jpg
c1,Michael Moore-backed ‘Planet of the Humans’ Takes Apart the Left’s Green Energy Scams,"Left-wing filmmaker Michael Moore released a new documentary, Planet of the Humans, on Tuesday, ahead of the 50th Earth Day on Apr. 22. Like most Moore projects, it targets corporate greed and hypocrisy. But this time, the greed and hypocrisy it targets are on the environmentalist left. The film exposes the solar and wind energy industries as scams that pretend to be saving the planet from climate change while consuming more fossil fuels than they save, and causing ecological damage.",https://www.breitbart.com/environment/2020/04/22/michael-moore-backed-planet-of-the-humans-takes-apart-the-lefts-green-energy-scams/,https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/01/BernieIowacelebs1-640x480.jpg
c2,‘Planet Of The Humans’ Documentary Released For Free On Eve Of Earth Day,"Planet of the Humans takes a harsh look at how the environmental movement has lost the battle through well-meaning but disastrous choices, including the belief that solar panels and windmills would save us, and by giving in to the corporate interests of Wall Street. Moore and Gibbs say they decided that with the American public – and much of the world – confined to their homes amid the coronavirus pandemic “and suddenly having to consider the role humans and their behavior have played in our fragile ecosystems, the moment was too urgent to wait until later this year for the film’s planned release.”",https://deadline.com/2020/04/michael-moore-releases-planet-of-the-humans-documentary-eve-earth-day-1202913761/,https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/planet-of-the-humans.jpg?crop=54px%2C0px%2C1558px%2C873px&resize=681%2C383
