d1,"Defeated Activist Greta Whines Climate Strikes Have ‘Achieved Nothing,’ Claims People Are ‘Dying Today’","In December, far-left activist Greta Thunberg struck a somber, defeatist tone while speaking to fellow climate activists gathered at the United Nations climate talks in Madrid, Spain. Thunberg claimed that people are currently “suffering and dying” due to effects of supposed man-made climate change. Since 2017, Thunberg has been pushed by politicos on the far-left and their allies in the media to lead the climate change agenda, which conveniently promotes socialist policies as solutions.",https://www.dailywire.com/news/defeated-greta-whines-climate-strikes-have-achieved-nothing-claims-people-are-dying-today,https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg
d2,Sadiq Khan to Blow £50m on ‘Green New Deal’ Instead of Police as London Gripped by Crime Wave,"London assembly member David Kurten grilled London mayor Sadiq Khan on his decision to plough tens of millions of pounds into a “Green New Deal” while violent crime spirals in London. Kurten said that money could have “paid for up to 800 extra police officers” to keep streets safe. In September of 2019, a 16-strong knife gang had targetted a group of young athletes in London’s Finsbury Park, robbing and threatening to kill the three white people in the group but telling the black people with them “You’re good.”",https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/02/25/sadiq-khan-blow-50m-green-new-deal-instead-police/,https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg
d3,Pete Buttigieg Falsely Claims That Climate Change Doomsday Deadline Is ‘2020’,"Claim: Pete Buttigieg said during Wednesday’s debate in Las Vegas, Nevada, that the climate change doomsday deadline is now and asserted that “we will never meet any of the other scientific or policy deadlines that we need to” if the country does not elect someone who will take action. Verdict: False. Climate change alarmists have been reconfiguring the so-called “doomsday” clock for years and have 50 years’ worth of failed predictions— predictions that faltered as the country continued to progress and reach its policy goals.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/20/pete-buttigieg-says-climate-change-doomsday-deadline-2020/,https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg
d4,NASA and NOAA’S latest climate warning is a result of purposefully flawed data.,"NASA and NOAA announced that 2019 was the second warmest year since modern record keeping began in 1880. But as has been hammered home repeatedly over the years by meteorologist Anthony Watts  (who is also a Senior Fellow with The Heartland Institute), rather than cite data from their best sources, NASA and NOAA chose to use severely compromised data from temperature readings adjusted—in a process called “homogenization”—they and others gathered from biased monitoring stations. Numerous reports have shown data manipulation is not limited to the United States, but is common across the globe.",https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/nasa-and-noaas-latest-climate-warning-is-a-result-of-purposefully-flawed-data,https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg
a1,Greta Thunberg nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to prevent Climate Change,"Two lawmakers in Sweden have nominated Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg for the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize. Jens Holm and Hakan Svenneling, who are both members of the Sweden’s Left Party, said Monday that Greta “has worked hard to make politicians open their eyes to the climate crisis” and “action for reducing our emissions and complying with the Paris agreement is therefore also an act of making peace.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/kidspost/greta-thunberg-nominated-for-nobel-peace-prize/2020/02/03/d296c146-46a7-11ea-ab15-b5df3261b710_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_1,https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg
a2,Study: global banks 'failing miserably' on climate crisis by funnelling trillions into fossil fuels,"The world’s largest investment banks have funnelled more than £2.2tn ($2.66tn) into fossil fuels since the Paris agreement, new figures show, prompting warnings they are failing to respond to the climate crisis. Analysis of the 35 leading global investment banks, by an alliance of US-based environmental groups, said that financing for the companies most aggressively expanding in new fossil fuel extraction since the Paris agreement has surged by nearly 40% in the last year.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/18/global-banks-climate-crisis-finance-fossil-fuels,https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg
a3,Fact checking the false claim about the role of Arson in Australia’s Bushfires,"Claim: Various claims online suggest that climate change hasn’t contributed to the bushfires ravaging the East Coast of Australia, pinning the blame instead on arson. Verdict: False. Australian Bureau of Meteorology said that the second half of 2019 was particularly dry across most of the southern half of Australia, and followed several years of below average rainfall over parts of Queensland and New South Wales. Those hot, dry conditions allowed for one of the most severe fire seasons on Australia’s East Coast in decades. “There are fingerprints of climate change in all of these blazes that really can’t be denied,” Jennifer Marlon, a research scientist at the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies said in an interview.",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/01/setting-the-record-straight-on-climate-change-and-arson-in-australias-bushfires/,https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg
a4,"Greenland, Antarctica Melting Six Times Faster Than in the 1990s","Observations from 11 satellite missions monitoring the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have revealed that the regions are losing ice six times faster than they were in the 1990s. If the current melting trend continues, the regions will be on track to match the ""worst-case"" scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of an extra 6.7 inches (17 centimetres) of sea level rise by 2100. The findings, published in the journal Nature from an international team of 89 polar scientists from 50 organizations, are the most comprehensive assessment to date of the changing ice sheets.",https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2958/greenland-antarctica-melting-six-times-faster-than-in-the-1990s/,https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg
