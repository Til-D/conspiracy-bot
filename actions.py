Thunberg claimed that people are currently \\u201csuffering and dying\\u201d due to effects of supposed man-made climate change. Since 2017, Thunberg has been pushed by politicos on the far-left and their allies in the media to lead the climate change agenda, which conveniently promotes socialist policies as solutions.", "link": "https://www.dailywire.com/news/defeated-greta-whines-climate-strikes-have-achieved-nothing-claims-people-are-dying-today", "image": "https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg"}, {"id": "d2", "headline": "Sadiq Khan to Blow \\u00a350m on \\u2018Green New Deal\\u2019 Instead of Police as London Gripped by Crime Wave", "summary": "London assembly member David Kurten grilled London mayor Sadiq Khan on his decision to plough tens of millions of pounds into a \\u201cGreen New Deal\\u201d while violent crime spirals in London.
